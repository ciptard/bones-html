Bones HTML Version

Bones is designed to make the life of developers easier. It's built
using HTML5 & has a strong semantic foundation. It was updated recently
using some of the HTML5 Boilerplate's recommended markup and setup. 
It's constantly growing so be sure to check back often if you are a 
frequent user. Contributions & Pull Requests are always welcome!
